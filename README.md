# Just a Trivial Bot
Reddit Trivia Bot development version

I've never used Node before and wanted to make a trivia bot. This is a test version that will be very broken and probably only accessible to me. 

Hopefully the bot will be able to:
* set up time-delimited trivia quizzes restricted by subreddit
* send lists of randomized questions to players
* receive answers and score them
* post scores and answers at the end of the specified time period.
